# Phase-Error-Correcting-Code
Error Correcting Codes (ECC) or Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) are integrated to improve robustness, reliability, or security. When referring to Error Correcting Codes, this phase typically involves implementing algorithms that detect and correct errors in input data, labels, or intermediate computations.
